For example:\n *\n *                                            <Paper>\n *  <Paper>                                     <div> // See notice\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>        renders         <div/> // before element\n *      [children of paper]       ------>         [children of paper]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                       <div/> // after element\n *  </Paper>                                    </div>\n *                                            </Paper>\n *\n *  Notice: Notice that this div bundles together our elements. If the element\n *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n *\n *  <p>\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n *  </p>\n *\n *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n *\n *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n */\n\nvar styles = {\n  box: {\n    boxSizing: 'border-box'\n  }\n};\n\nvar BeforeAfterWrapper = _react2.default.createClass({\n  displayName: 'BeforeAfterWrapper',\n\n\n  propTypes: {\n    afterElementType: _react2.default.PropTypes.string,\n    afterStyle: _react2.default.PropTypes.object,\n    beforeElementType: _react2.default.PropTypes.string,\n    beforeStyle: _react2.default.PropTypes.object,\n    children: _react2.default.PropTypes.node,\n    elementType: _react2.default.PropTypes.string,\n\n    /**\n     * Override the inline-styles of the root element.\n     */\n    style: _react2.default.PropTypes.object\n  },\n\n  contextTypes: {\n    muiTheme: _react2.default.PropTypes.object\n  },\n\n  childContextTypes: {\n    muiTheme: _react2.default.PropTypes.object\n  },\n\n  getDefaultProps: function getDefaultProps() {\n    return {\n      beforeElementType: 'div',\n      afterElementType: 'div',\n      elementType: 'div'\n    };\n  },\n  getInitialState: function getInitialState() {\n    return {\n      muiTheme: this.context.muiTheme || (0, _getMuiTheme2.default)()\n    };\n  },\n  getChildContext: function getChildContext() {\n    return {\n      muiTheme: this.state.muiTheme\n    };\n  },\n  componentWillReceiveProps: function componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps, nextContext) {\n    this.setState({\n      muiTheme: nextContext.muiTheme || this.state.muiTheme\n    });\n  },\n  render: function render() {\n    var _props = this.props;\n    var beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle;\n    var afterStyle = _props.afterStyle;\n    var beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType;\n    var afterElementType = _props.afterElementType;\n    var elementType = _props.elementType;\n\n    var other = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\n\n    var prepareStyles = this.state.muiTheme.prepareStyles;\n\n\n    var beforeElement = void 0;\n    var afterElement = void 0;\n\n    if (beforeStyle) {\n      beforeElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, {\n        style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, beforeStyle)),\n        key: '::before'\n      });\n    }\n\n    if (afterStyle) {\n      afterElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, {\n        style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, afterStyle)),\n        key: '::after'\n      });\n    }\n\n    var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\n\n    var props = other;\n    props.style = prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, this.props.style));\n\n    return _react2.default.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\n  }\n});\n\nexports.default = BeforeAfterWrapper;\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/material-ui/lib/before-after-wrapper.js\n ** module id = 153\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\n\nvar _simpleAssign = require('simple-assign');\n\nvar _simpleAssign2 = _interopRequireDefault(_simpleAssign);\n\nvar _react = require('react');\n\nvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\nvar _keyboardArrowUp = require('../svg-icons/hardware/keyboard-arrow-up');\n\nvar _keyboardArrowUp2 = _interopRequireDefault(_keyboardArrowUp);\n\nvar _keyboardArrowDown = require('../svg-icons/hardware/keyboard-arrow-down');\n\nvar _keyboardArrowDown2 = _interopRequireDefault(_keyboardArrowDown);\n\nvar _iconButton = require('../icon-button');\n\nvar _iconButton2 = _interopRequireDefault(_iconButton);\n\nvar _getMuiTheme = require('../styles/getMuiTheme');\n\nvar _getMuiTheme2 = _interopRequireDefault(_getMuiTheme);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?
